- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) 
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) 
- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/)

For authentication scaffolding the project uses [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/).

The project uses Laravel's [Queued Jobs](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues) to send emails and record analytics data.

### Project Document

This was developed for the requirements of a Server Side Programming module.
The assignment document is available here: [SSP2_FINAL2_CB010454.pdf](SSP2_FINAL2_CB010454.pdf)

## Features

The following are some of the features of the project. To provide a better understanding of the features some screenshots are also provided where necessary.

**‚úÖ Use of middleware to grant role based access to routes**

A middleware was created to validate the role of the user and grant access to the routes. 
When using the middleware the name of the required roles are passed seperated by a comma.
The routes associated for the users based on the roles are grouped in the web.php file.

**üè¨ Location Management**

The admin user can create, edit and delete locations. These locations are used when booking an appointment. 
For the purpose of the assignment, only one appointment per time slot is possible in the system.

**üë§User management**

<br /><br />


**üíá Categories and Service management**

Admin and employee users can create, edit and delete service categories.

<br /><br />

When a new service is created, the customers are notified by email.
This is done using a queued job. [Check out how to start the queue in laravel](#using-the-queue)

<br /><br />

**üÜï Booking an appointment**

The appointment booking is done by first adding to the cart: the customer selects the location of the
booking, and the date. The system then checks for availability and disables and grey out the timeslots that are
not available. Then the customer can select a time slot and add it to the cart.

<figure>
<img src="readme-assets/screenshots/services-page.png">
<figcaption align="center"><i>Services</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<br /><br />

The system displays the timeslots of a location that are available when the user selects the location and date.
The system disables and greys out the unavailable time slots.

_Take Note of the greyed out unavailable time slot below_

<br /><br />


**üõí Cart**

A cart system was created for the user to add the services to the cart. It also included creation of
a pivot table called cart_services. The system checks if there are any booking for that time slot
before creation of the appointment at Checkout

<br /><br />

**üìÉ Appointment creation**

At checkout the appointment is created. Then an email is sent to the customer as a confirmation
of the booking. This email is sent using a queued job. [Check out how to start the queue in laravel](#using-the-queue)
